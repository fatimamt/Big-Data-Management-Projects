    "2. ___How much is \"Big Data\"?___\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no right or wrong answer. Big Data has been defined in so many ways that ended up being a difficult concept to understand. Nonetheless, we now we encounter Big Data when the complexity of the database and its scalability get more difficult to work with in a traditional database technology.\n",
    "3. ___How will Big Data techniques help?___\n",
    "\n",
    "They address scalability and complexity issues. For instance, when it comes to scaling terms, you just need to add nodes, and, by nature, the systems will automatically rebalance onto the new nodes.\n",
    "4. ___What does a data system do?___\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A data system answers questions based on information that was acquired in the past up to the present.\" They also combine bits an pieces together to produce their answers by looking at the entire dataset. The main properties for a Big Data System is the complexity and scalability.\n",

    "1. ___What is the master dataset?___\n",
    "\n",
    "You could reconstruct your application from the master dataset. This is because the batch views served by the serving layer are produced via functions on the master dataset, and since the speed layer is based only on recent data, it can construct itself within a few hours.\n",
    "2. ___What is the relationship between data, views, and queries?___\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is the information, let's compare it with programming languages, of first level, that cannot be delivered from anything else. This information is converted into views (batch layer in Lambda Architecture) computed to hel answer queries, and finally, queries is what the user want to get answered.\n",

    "\n",
    "Big Data systems, initially, is raw data, and it can be processed and analyzed.\n",
    "4. ___What does the fact-based model do?___\n",
    "\n",
    "It stores raw data as atomic facts (that can't be subdivided further into meaningful components), keeps the facts immutable and eternally true by using tiemstamps, and ensures each fact is identificable so that query processingg can iddentify duplicates.\n",
    "5. ___Why to choose the fact-based model?___\n",
    "\n",
    "Your master dataset will be an ever-growing list of immutable, atomic facts. Therefore, your dataset become queryable at any time, it achieve the human-fault tolerance by deleting any erroneous facts, unknown facts esaily become new one, and it stores the information at both the batch and serving layers so your data keep normalized and denormalized.\n",
    "6. ___What is the purpose of a graph schema?___\n",
    "\n",
    "It shows graphically the structure of a dataset stored in a fact-based model. Its elements include, nodes, edges and properties."
