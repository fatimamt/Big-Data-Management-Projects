# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

Short questionarie based on the book by Martin Kleppmann.

## Chapter 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

### 1. Differences between data-intensive and compute-intensive.
Compute-intensive demands computation work where most of their execution time is devoted to computational requirements
whereas data-intensive is a class of applications that use data paralell aproach to process large volumes of data (with size of tera or petabytes).

### 2. What are the caracteristics that make a system reliable? Mention an example of a not reliable system.
The reliability of a systems comes when it performs its intended functionality satisfactorily even under specific environmental and operating conditions. In data set terms, an example of the lack of system reliability is a relational database system (RDBS), which does  not fulfill the demand of information to store.
